# üîê keycloak_KDA

This project is a Keycloak add-on that detects whether a password was entered manually or via automation.  
It serves as an early prototype for implementing **Keystroke Dynamics-Based Authentication** in Keycloak.

> **Note:** This was developed as part of a Bachelor's thesis and may include some less optimal practices. If you're an experienced Keycloak developer, feel free to improve and adapt.

## üí° How It Works

Keycloak allows for the extension of its functionality via custom **providers**.

This project introduces:
1. A **custom authentication flow** (backend provider)
2. A **custom login theme** (frontend keystroke capture for the flow to work)

These two components work together to analyze keystroke dynamics and detect automation.

---

## How to Build the Provider
Building the provider is the most complicated it gets. Everything afterwards should be straightforward.

### Steps:

1. Clone the Keycloak GitHub repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak.git
   cd keycloak
   ```

2. Copy the `keystroke-dynamics` folder (the main module folder of this repo) into the Keycloak project root.

3. Add the module to Keycloak's `pom.xml`:
   ```xml
   <module>keystroke-dynamics</module>
   ```

4. Run the Maven build for the module:
   ```bash
   ./mvnw clean install -pl :keystroke-dynamics -am -DskipTests
   ```

5. After a successful build, you'll find the `.jar` file here:
   ```
   keystroke-dynamics/target/keystroke-dynamics-999.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
   ```

## üé® Where's the Custom Theme?

Inside this repo‚Äôs root folder, there‚Äôs a `theme/kd-custom/` directory.  
This contains the **custom login theme** used to inject JavaScript for keystroke capture and support the custom authentication flow.

> **Important:** The theme is based on the `keycloak.v2` theme system introduced in Keycloak 22+ and specifically developed for version **26.3.2**.

The only file that **overrides** a Keycloak-provided template is `login.ftl`. It works as-is, but **may require updates** in future Keycloak versions if the structure of the base `login.ftl` changes.

üîß If you're working with a newer Keycloak version and want to update the overridden file accordingly, see [Theme Update Instructions](THEME_OVERRIDES.md).

## üß© How to Integrate the Add-on with a Keycloak Installation

If you haven‚Äôt yet set up Keycloak, follow these steps:

1. **Download** a Keycloak release from  
   https://www.keycloak.org/downloads

2. **Unpack** it into a directory of your choice.

3. **Copy the Provider JAR** into:
   ```
   keycloak-[version]/providers/
   ```

4. **Copy the Theme** (`kd-custom`) into:
   ```
   keycloak-[version]/themes/
   ```
   > ‚ö†Ô∏è Only copy the `kd-custom` folder ‚Äî not the parent `theme` directory.

5. Add a **bootstrap admin user** (if necessary) by executing: 
    - **Linux/macOS**: `bin/kc.sh bootstrap-admin user`
    - **Windows**: `bin\kc.bat bootstrap-admin user`

6. **Build Keycloak** to register the new provider and theme:
   - **Linux/macOS**: `bin/kc.sh build`
   - **Windows**: `bin\kc.bat build`

7. **Start Keycloak in development mode**:
   - **Linux/macOS**: `bin/kc.sh start-dev`
   - **Windows**: `bin\kc.bat start-dev`

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Activate the New Authentication Flow

1. **Log in** to the Keycloak Admin Console.
2. Go to **Realm Settings ‚Üí Themes**.
   - Set **Login Theme** to `kd-custom`
   - Click **Save**
3. Navigate to **Authentication ‚Üí Flows**.
4. Click **Create Flow**
   - Name it `KD Browser Flow` (or something similar)
   - Click **Create**
5. Select your new flow, then click **Add Execution**
   - Choose: `KD Username Password Form` (may not be on the first page)
6. Set its **Requirement** to `Required`
7. Click the **Actions** dropdown ‚Üí **Bind Flow**
8. The custom flow should now be active and in use.

## üß™ Final Notes

- This is an experimental feature.
- By default, many printers usefull for debugging are enabled through a flag in `KDFormAuhtenticator`. If you don't want that, and before entering production, this flag should be changed to disable the printers.
- You can use browser dev tools to verify that your custom JavaScript files (e.g. `keystroke-logger.js`) are being loaded.
- If you encounter any build or runtime issues, consider clearing your Keycloak build cache and rebuilding (`kc.sh build` again).

## üì¨ Feedback / Contributions

If you're a Keycloak expert and see ways to improve the setup or code, feel free to open an issue or pull request. I can not promise to react quickly, but generally speaking, this project is educational, and input is welcome!
